# Introduction

Operators tell the compiler or interpreter to perform a specific mathematical, relational, or logical operation. Many programming languages make use of similar operator symbols.

We will go through the important arithmetic, relational, and logical operators available in Rust and we will compare them to Python.

We will learn the differences between methods and associated functions.

We also convert two simple Python codes to Rust codes to learn more about Rust programming.
Letâ€™s get started!
